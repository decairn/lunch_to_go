## Coverage summary

- Vitest suites span API helpers (`app/src/lib/api/__tests__`), domain mappers, storage adapters, telemetry, and page stores.
- React Testing Library specs in `app/src/app/__tests__` validate routed UI, guarded flows, accent/theme persistence, and demo interactions.
- Playwright scenarios exercise accessibility, demo workflows, and performance budgets across Chromium and Edge (WebView2) browsers.
- Desktop smoke tests confirm NSIS packaging, silent install/uninstall, Credential Locker storage, and authenticated API access (optional) on Windows.
- Manual reviews (security, release readiness) are logged in `docs/` and tied back to `specs/tasks.md` for traceability.
